1.0.2 (2015-04-29)
++++++++++++++++++++

Fixes:

* ``python setup.py test`` causes SandboxViolation.

Improvements:

++++++++++++++++++++

Fixes:

1.0 (2014-03-22)
++++++++++++++++++++

New features:

* Support idna.
* Assignable :attr:`.Session.cookiestring`.

Backwards-incompatible changes:

* Remove ``raw_header`` and ``raw_response``.
* :func:`random_useragent` now takes a single ``filename`` as parameter. It used to be a list of filenames.
* No more ``.title()`` on request headers' keys.
* Exceptions are re-designed. :class:`socket.timeout` now is :class:`.Timeout`, ..., see section `Exceptions` in :doc:`reference` for more details.

Fixes:

* Parsing links: If ``Link`` header is empty, ``[]`` should be returned, not ``[{'url': ''}]``.
* Http request's ``Host`` header should include the port. Using ``netloc`` as the http host header is wrong, it could include user:pass.
* Redirects: ``Host`` in reqheaders should be ``host:port``.
* Streaming decompress not working.


0.6.2 (2014-03-22)
++++++++++++++++++++

Fix:

Fix:

* :func:`urlfetch.mb_code` may silently return incorrect result, since the encode errors are replaced, it should be decode properly and then encode without replace.
